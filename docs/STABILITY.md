# Stability Contract

BrickflowUI 0.1.13 targets Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12. The source metadata also permits newer interpreters, but each release claim is limited to the interpreters actually exercised by CI or the release report.

## Supported runtime contract

- The production React frontend bundle is mandatory. A complete wheel includes `brickflowui/frontend/dist/index.html` and its referenced hashed assets.
- If those files are missing, the server returns HTTP 503 with an actionable diagnostic. It does not start a partial fallback renderer or open a WebSocket.
- Python VNodes, serialized event props, patch operations, browser navigation, and session-scoped state form one versioned runtime contract and must be tested together.
- A stable release means no known reproducible critical or high-severity defect remains in the supported core paths. It is not a security certification or a guarantee that no undiscovered defect exists.

## Local verification

From the repository root:

```text
python -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider
python scripts/generate_component_reference.py
git diff --exit-code -- docs/components/reference
python -m mkdocs build --strict
python -m build
```

From `frontend/`:

```text
npm ci
npm test -- --run
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm audit --audit-level=high
npm run build
```

Release verification additionally inspects the wheel and source distribution, installs the wheel into an isolated environment, starts a minimal application outside the source tree, and checks browser load, WebSocket interaction, direct links, reconnect behavior, theme switching, narrow layouts, and browser-console errors.

## Known capability boundaries

- `CatalogBrowser`, `WarehouseSelector`, and `JobTrigger` have server-driven renderer, loading, empty, disabled, error, and event contracts. Databricks operations remain explicit Python calls so credentials and SDK objects never enter the browser.
- Per-user and shared-app identity are both supported. User SQL/SDK clients are operation-scoped from forwarded authorization headers; the guarded app-identity SQL connection is reusable. A deployment must still configure and verify the required Databricks authorization scopes.
- Formal concurrency, load, long-running-session, and deployed Databricks Apps validation are separate production-lifecycle gates.
- Browser and platform results are recorded in the current verification report; unavailable infrastructure is reported as a limitation rather than inferred as passing.
