# Architecture

This page explains BrickflowUI end to end: what runs in Python, what runs in the browser, how state moves, how events are serialized, and what must ship for Databricks Apps to work reliably.

Pair this page with:

- [Databricks Apps Guide](./DATABRICKS_APPS.md)
- [Troubleshooting](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

## System shape

BrickflowUI is a Python runtime plus a packaged frontend bundle.

```text
Python app code
  -> page functions
  -> VNode tree
  -> FastAPI + WebSocket runtime
  -> JSON full tree / JSON patches
  -> React renderer in the browser
  -> user events
  -> Python handlers and state updates
```

## Runtime layers

### 1. App authoring layer

You write pure Python:

- `App`
- `@app.page(...)`
- `@app.route(...)`
- `use_state`, `use_effect`, `use_memo`
- component functions from `brickflowui.components`

The authoring model feels similar to a React component tree, but the tree is created in Python.

### 2. Virtual UI layer

Every component returns a `VNode`.

A `VNode` contains:

- `type`
- `props`
- `children`
- event handlers that are registered server-side and exposed as event ids to the browser

This keeps the wire protocol small and framework-specific.

### 3. Server runtime

`brickflowui.server` creates the ASGI app.

The runtime is responsible for:

- serving the frontend shell from `brickflowui/frontend/dist/index.html`
- serving static assets from `brickflowui/frontend/dist/assets/`
- opening the `/events` WebSocket
- rendering a full tree on first connect
- diffing old and new trees on updates
- applying auth checks for pages and routes
- adding security headers

### 4. Frontend runtime

The browser receives:

- a full tree on first render
- incremental patches after state changes

The React renderer maps each serialized node type to a real UI primitive:

- layout
- inputs
- tables
- charts
- overlays
- pipeline graph
- chatbot controls

## Render lifecycle

### First render

1. Browser loads the HTML shell.
2. Frontend connects to `/events`.
3. Server creates a session-specific `RenderContext`.
4. The current page function runs.
5. The resulting VNode tree is serialized and sent to the browser.

### Interactive update

1. User clicks, types, toggles, or submits.
2. Frontend sends an event id plus payload to the server.
3. Python handler runs.
4. Any `use_state(...)` setter marks the session dirty.
5. The page re-renders.
6. The VDOM diff is turned into patches.
7. Browser applies patches and updates the UI.

## State model

State is session-scoped, not global.

That means:

- each browser session gets isolated state
- one user's filters do not affect another user's dashboard
- navigation resets the active page tree for that session

Important files:

- `brickflowui/state.py`
- `brickflowui/app.py`
- `brickflowui/server.py`

## Routing model

BrickflowUI supports two runtime channels:

- page routing with `@app.page(...)`
- API routing with `@app.route(...)`

Use pages for:

- dashboards
- landing pages
- chatbot workspaces
- app navigation

Use custom routes for:

- form submission
- JSON APIs
- webhook-style endpoints
- explicit HTTP integrations

## Frontend packaging

The built frontend is part of the Python package.

Required package paths:

```text
brickflowui/frontend/dist/index.html
brickflowui/frontend/dist/assets/*
```

If those files are missing in the installed package, Databricks Apps will often get stuck at a loading shell such as "Connecting to runtime...".

## Security model

The server currently applies:

- CSP headers
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`
- origin checks for WebSocket sessions
- optional trusted host middleware
- page and route access control

Security design principle:

- the browser is a renderer and event source
- the server stays authoritative for state and access decisions

## Performance model

The main performance wins come from:

- no frontend build step in production
- session-scoped state
- incremental patch updates instead of full page reloads
- bundled local assets for CSP-restricted environments

The main performance risks come from:

- expensive work inside event handlers
- expensive work inside page functions on every render
- large tables or chart payloads passed without filtering or pagination

## Mobile and responsive behavior

Responsiveness lives in the frontend theme and renderer layer.

Current principles:

- rows wrap by default
- grids collapse down to one column on small screens
- sidebar becomes mobile-toggle navigation
- overlays, drawers, toasts, and date range controls adapt to narrow screens

If a page is still hard to use on mobile, the fix is usually:

- page composition
- overly wide tables
- chart density
- custom inline styles

## Databricks deployment model

Databricks Apps care about a few things more than a normal local dev app:

- the port comes from the environment
- the Python package must already contain the built frontend
- the app command should run Python directly
- CSP is stricter than many local dev environments

Recommended deployment flow:

1. Build the frontend.
2. Build the Python package.
3. Verify the wheel contains `brickflowui/frontend/dist`.
4. Install from the wheel or a GitHub ref.
5. Deploy with `app.py`, `app.yaml`, and `requirements.txt`.

## File map

These files matter most when debugging architecture problems:

- `brickflowui/app.py`
- `brickflowui/components.py`
- `brickflowui/state.py`
- `brickflowui/vdom.py`
- `brickflowui/server.py`
- `frontend/src/App.tsx`
- `frontend/src/Renderer.tsx`
- `frontend/src/theme.css`
- `frontend/vite.config.ts`
- `pyproject.toml`

## Architecture checklist

When a BrickflowUI app behaves strangely, check these in order:

1. Is the frontend bundle present in the installed package?
2. Is the WebSocket connecting successfully?
3. Is the event payload reaching Python correctly?
4. Is the session state updating and marking the tree dirty?
5. Is the rerender producing a patch or a full-tree error?
6. Is the issue in the framework, or in page composition/custom styles?
