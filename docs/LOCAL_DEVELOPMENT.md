# Local Development

This page is the practical guide for developing BrickflowUI apps locally before you move them into Databricks Apps or any shared environment.

## What Local Development Should Cover

A solid local workflow should answer these questions clearly:

- How do I run the app?
- How do I work with auth locally?
- How do I use local logos, images, GIFs, or videos?
- How do I debug loading, WebSocket state, and route handlers?
- How do I test dark mode, light mode, and responsive navigation?

Use these examples as your default local validation loop:

- `examples/local_playground/app.py` for fast interaction, theme, media, and responsiveness checks
- `examples/component_studio/app.py` when you want a broader component tour
- `examples/acme_analytics_command_center/app.py` when you want to test a more product-style shell

## Run A Local App

```python
import brickflowui as db

app = db.App(title="Local Studio")

@app.page("/")
def home():
    return db.Text("Local runtime is healthy.", variant="h2")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

Then start it with:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Recommended Local Loop

1. Start the app with `python app.py`
2. Open it in the browser
3. Keep browser devtools open
4. Watch the WebSocket connection at `/events`
5. Trigger controls and confirm you see state patches come back

## Local Auth Patterns

BrickflowUI supports application identity and user identity patterns. For local development, the most practical path is header-based testing.

```python
import brickflowui as db
from brickflowui.auth import HeaderAuthProvider

app = db.App(
    auth_mode="user",
    auth_provider=HeaderAuthProvider(),
    allow_anonymous=False,
)
```

Then send a local request header such as:

```text
x-brickflow-user-id: alice
```

This is useful for:

- testing route protection
- testing page-level access control
- validating role-gated flows
- building secure internal tools before identity is wired to the real platform

## Local Images, GIFs, Videos, And Logos

You can now point media components and loading assets to local files directly from Python:

```python
app = db.App(
    loading={
        "title": "Acme Workspace",
        "subtitle": "Preparing your runtime",
        "asset": "assets/loader.gif",
    }
)

hero = db.Hero(
    "Command center",
    tagline="Built with BrickflowUI",
    image="assets/logo.svg",
)

preview = db.Image("assets/screenshot.png", alt="Preview", variant="content")
avatar = db.Image("assets/operator.png", alt="Operator", variant="avatar", width="40px")
demo = db.Video("assets/demo.mp4", poster="assets/poster.png")
```

The runtime serves those files automatically through a safe asset route, so you do not need to mount a separate static server just to get branding or demos on screen.

## Responsive Development

When testing local responsiveness, verify these behaviors:

- `Sidebar` should collapse behind a mobile menu button
- `TopNav` should collapse into a mobile menu automatically
- tables should remain scrollable without breaking the page shell
- cards and grids should stack instead of overflowing horizontally
- forms should stay usable inside drawers, popups, and modals

## Default Backend Loading Behavior

BrickflowUI now tracks backend event lifecycles automatically for common interactive controls.

That means when the user:

- clicks a button
- changes a select
- toggles a checkbox or switch
- adjusts a slider
- submits a chat prompt
- updates a multi-select or date range

the component can show loading while the backend handler is running and clear that state when the runtime finishes processing.

This is especially useful when:

- you query a warehouse
- you call a model endpoint
- you load heavy dashboard state
- you need to prevent repeated clicks while the backend is still working

For text-oriented controls such as `Input` and `ChatInput`, the framework now keeps typing local-first by default and syncs changes back to Python with a debounce. That avoids a full round-trip on every character while preserving controlled state.

On top of that, frontend tree updates are now applied on the next animation frame and treated as non-urgent work in React. That means the UI is more resilient when the backend is chatty or a page has several interactive regions updating at once.

## Useful Debug Checks

If something looks stuck, check these in order:

1. Confirm the browser shows a successful WebSocket connection.
2. Confirm the event handler actually updates state or completes cleanly.
3. Confirm the packaged frontend assets exist in `brickflowui/frontend/dist`.
4. Confirm local asset paths point to real files.
5. Confirm the browser is not serving an older cached bundle.

## Theme Modes During Local Development

If your app defines both modes, you can test them right away:

```python
app = db.App(
    theme={
        "default_mode": "light",
        "dark_mode": {
            "colors": {"background": "#0A0F1E", "surface": "#0F172A", "text": "#F1F5F9"}
        },
    }
)
```

Then surface a toggle with:

```python
db.ThemeToggle()
```

or let `Sidebar` / `TopNav` show it automatically.

If you omit `dark_mode`, BrickflowUI stays in light mode by default. That is the safe baseline for older examples and new YAML theme files.
